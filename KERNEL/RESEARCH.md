# MAXX_KERNEL Development Research

## [1] Minimal AI-Inference Engine for MAXX_KERNEL Integration

Embedded and kernel-level AI requires **tiny, highly optimized models and inference engines** due to strict memory and compute limits. Recent advances in *TinyML* demonstrate that even Transformer and LSTM/RNN models can run in extremely constrained environments.

### Recommended AI Models for MAXX_KERNEL:
- **Tiny Transformers** (e.g., MiniLM, TinyBERT)
- Compact **LSTM/GRU RNNs**
- Quantized/pruned networks (int8 precision recommended)

### Suggested Lightweight Inference Engines:
- **TensorFlow Lite Micro (TFLM)** – Google’s minimal runtime, ideal for kernel integration due to static memory management.
- **ARM CMSIS-NN** – Optimized neural network kernels for ARM microcontrollers.
- **NNoM and Tinn** – Minimal C-based neural network libraries suitable for bare-metal execution.
- **Edge Impulse** – Tools to export minimal C code directly suitable for MAXX_KERNEL.
