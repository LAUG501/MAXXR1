# LCARS REPORT: MAXX_KERNEL CODE ESTIMATION

ESTIMATED LINES OF CODE (LOC):

| MODULE                                     | LOC ESTIMATE |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [1] MAXX_BOOT_LOADER (Assembly/C)          | ~500–1,500   |
| [2] MAXX_KERNEL CORE                       | ~2,000–4,000 |
| [3] AI-FIRST INTEGRATION (Minimal Engine)  | ~1,500–3,000 |
| [4] INPUT/OUTPUT CONTROL SYSTEM            | ~1,000–2,500 |
| [5] SECURITY & INTEGRITY MODULE            | ~800–1,500   |
| [6] FILESYSTEM INTERFACE                   | ~1,000–2,000 |
| [7] NETWORK STACK (Minimal)                | ~1,000–2,000 |
| [8] ERROR HANDLING & REPORTING SYSTEM      | ~500–1,500   |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED LINES**                  | **~8,300–18,000** |

**ESTIMATION BASIS:**
- Minimalist kernel projects typically range from **8,000 to 15,000 LOC**.
- AI inference integration at kernel-level is uncommon; additional complexity factored in.

**RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENT PHASES:**
- **INITIAL PROTOTYPE:** ~8,000–10,000 LOC
- **RELEASE-STAGE (STABLE):** ~15,000–18,000 LOC
