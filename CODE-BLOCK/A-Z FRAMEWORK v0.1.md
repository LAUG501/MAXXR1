## ✅ CRYPTO LEDGER LAYER    
- Each message passed through nodes is tagged with:    
  - `TX-ID` (Transaction ID)    
  - `NODE-ID` route sequence    
  - `USER-TAG` for security clearance    
  - `TOKEN-PATH` for billing, energy tracking or Maxx-Coin equivalence    

## ✅ FILE SYSTEM MAPPING    
- Terminals store per-node logs and artifacts:    
  - `DOC-A01.md` → Acquisition Logs    
  - `DOC-R18.log` → Reflection Engine Failures    
  - `NODE-X24.artifact.json` → Cross-topic bridges from large chats    

## ✅ SECURITY / ERROR SYSTEM  
- Every node writes to:    
  - `SECLOG.ndx` = System-wide violation index    
  - `ERRTRAC.rpt` = Human-readable error trail    
  - `AUDIT-LEDGER.cha` = Chain-of-proof for forensic backtrace
